# Goals of the Apocalypse Drive

The Apocalypse Drive is a curated knowledge archive designed to support human survival, recovery,
and flourishing in the wake of disasters, collapse, or long-term crises. Its ultimate aim is not
only to ensure continued existence, but to preserve wisdom, dignity, and meaning

Aim to gather enough practical and cultural knowledge to reliably:
1. Prepare Before Emergencies
  * Anticipate risks through local hazard assessment
  * Build personal, family, and community resilience
  * Establish survival caches, communications plans, and go-bags

2. React to Emergencies and Catastrophes
  * Respond to natural disasters, conflict zones, pandemics, and systemic collapse
  * Provide field-ready guidance for first aid, search & rescue, triage, and civil coordination

3. Ensure Short-Term Survival
  * Secure water, food, shelter, and warmth under adverse conditions
  * Provide practical bushcraft, urban survival, and wilderness medicine

4. Rebuild Basic Society
  * Restore clean water, sanitation, agriculture, basic health care, and education
  * Guide community formation, conflict resolution, and local governance
  * Understand ecosystems and how to steward natural resources
    * Rewilding, soil regeneration, watershed protection, biodiversity support

5. Scavenge and Repair Electronics
  * Identify, harvest, and reuse components from modern devices
  * Provide reference materials for electronic diagnostics and repairs

6. Generate and Store Electricity
  * Harness energy via solar, wind, hydro, combustion, thermoelectric, and manual systems
  * Store power using salvageable batteries and buildable capacitor arrays

7. Rebuild Communication Infrastructure

a. Home Networks
  * Maintain or rebuild basic computing and local networking (mesh, LAN, SDR)

b. Radio Communications
  * Build, power, and deploy long-range and short-range radios with improvised or salvaged gear

c. Internet Infrastructure
  * Recreate elements of global networks (DNS, routing, ISPs) in limited or decentralized form

8. Prevent Future Collapse through Knowledge and Culture
  * Preserve philosophy, history, law, science, and ethics
  * Integrate lessons from past collapses and cultural resilience
  * Establish cooperative systems across independent communities
    * Facilitate diplomacy, logistics, standardization, and defense between multiple groups or enclaves

9. Restore Joy, Community, and Humanity
  * Reintroduce art, play, ritual, song, storytelling, and collective meaning
  * Support mental health, social bonding, and the regeneration of thriving communities

# Storing the data

### File Formats & Presentation for RAG

* OCR'ed PDFs (high-quality, tables readable)
* Video & audio: resources â†’ transcripts (YouTube, field recordings, podcasts)
* 3D models (`.stl`, `.obj`), technical diagrams, schematics, and blueprints (as reference assets, not LLM-interpretable in raw 3D format)
* Decision trees and scenario-based flowcharts for troubleshooting and triage

* `.svg`: schematics Lightweight, scalable diagrams; easy to parse or render in-browser or via e-reader
* `.epub`: Efficient storage of eBooks with metadata & table of contents
* Diagrmas for teaching complex systems (agroecology, electronics, power grids)


# LLM Query: Additional Information?

Use the LLM to ask:
* What additional resources, data types, or scenario-specific knowledge would be most useful for an LLM to provide expert advice during/after disasters and societal collapse?


# Other data to hoard

* All of the English wikipedia?
* Movies & TV?
