# 1. Practical Storage Formats

Storage:
* Keep some information in a bug-out bag (durable waterproof books & cards)
  * Organized into "kits"
  * Survival kit, medicine kit, agriculture kit, defense kit, etc.
* Store other information in a portable format (microfilm)
  * For compact storage that can be easily consumed with low-tech
  * Shelter guide, energy guide, tools guide, etc
* Hide the rest of the information in a long-term cache (etched onto ceramic).
  * Scholarly papers, blueprints, textbooks
* Create an lookup index for locating information

Also:
* Durable hard copies: 
  * Print essential manuals on archival (acid-free) paper or waterproof/tear-resistant paper, then store in sealed containers.
* Microfilm or microfiche: 
  * Extremely space-efficient, can last for decades if kept dry and cool; requires only a magnifying device (no electricity) to read.
* Etched metal or clay tablets: 
  * For the absolute longest-term “hard copy,” albeit more limited in capacity.
* Digital backups: 
  * Portable storage (e.g., ruggedized external drives, SD cards) locked away in EMP-shielded enclosures—but remember these may be unusable unless you preserve some electronics and the knowledge to power them.
* Durable Information Formats
  * Microfilm/microfiche (long shelf life, can be read with a simple magnifier).
  * Archival paper with proper storage to prevent moisture/mold.
  * Simple metal etching (e.g., steel or aluminum plates) for extremely critical data.

6.1 Physical Books
* Collect high-quality, durable reference books on each topic.
* Store in waterproof, pest-proof containers.
* Keep in a stable environment (low humidity, moderate temperature).

6.2 Archival Paper or Microfilm
* Print key manuscripts on acid-free or archival-quality paper.
* Microfilm (or microfiche) can store thousands of pages in a compact, stable format—viewable with a simple magnifier or improvised projector.

6.3 Digital Storage (with a Plan)
* While digital formats (hard drives, USB sticks) can store vast amounts of data, they depend on future availability of compatible technology and power.
* If preserving digital media, also include instructions and hardware for reading it (e.g., a low-power laptop, solar charger, instructions on battery maintenance).
* Consider including open-source software archives and code repositories on robust media (e.g., specialized optical discs, M-DISC).

6.4 Multiple, Redundant Caches
* Spread out copies of crucial resources in multiple locations.
* Fireproof safes or sealed metal containers underground might protect from disasters.


# 2. Hoarding Knowledge

* Prioritize by Impact: 
  * Start with essential survival knowledge—food, water, shelter, medicine—before moving to advanced topics.
* Local Relevance: 
  * Tailor what you store to the climate, resources, and cultural context of your region (e.g., desert survival vs. cold climate).
* Multiple Copies & Caches: 
  * Redundancy is key—store copies in multiple locations to mitigate fire, flooding, or theft.
* Practical Accessibility: 
  * Make sure that what you preserve can be used with the simplest possible tools and minimal specialized training.
* Teach as You Hoard: 
  * If you have a community or family, share knowledge ahead of time. Post-collapse, a living teacher is as valuable as any manual.


# 3. For the Technical Knowledge

* Storage Media
  * External hard drives or robust optical media (e.g. M-DISCs) containing your OS/package repositories, how-to PDFs, and source code.
  * USB flash drives can degrade over time; keep multiple copies in sealed containers.

* Choose Durable Storage Formats
  * High-quality paper printouts for the most critical diagrams and instructions.
  * Archival optical discs (e.g., M-DISC) or microfilm for super-long-term durability.


# 4 Other Ideas

Bury a solid-state hard drive in a secure location with power & data cables protruding
Have a computer run this job regularly: wake, pull repos, copy data onto SSD, sleep
If disaster comes, this SSD can be retrieved and will have the latest version of the relevant repos

Also bury a cache of critical electronics in a secure location:
* a few laptops, a lens for microfilm, a projector, a router, a network switch, a blu-ray reader/writer, 
* batteries, a pump, solar panel, battery management system, spools of cables, windmill generator, lightbulbs, flashlights, 
* water, seeds, soil management chemicals & tests, hoses,
* fishing line, lures, traps, snares, rifles, barbed wire, chicken wire,
* food dehydrator, pressure cooker, curing salt, 
* inkjet printer, movable type printing press, ink & toner, 
* laboratory equipment, scientific glassware, key reagents, acids, bases, and source materials (ammonia, etc)
* charcoal kiln, pottery kiln, chainsaw, 
* copper, iron, steel, aluminum, brass, bronze, lithium, potassium, sodium, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine
* Tools:
  * Agriculture: scythe, plow, soil aerator, seed sprayer
  * Toolmaking: anvil, hammer, plier, 
  * Construction: wrench, nuts & bolts, nails, screws, drill, saw, planer, level, right angle, 
  * Cloth: shears, scissors, sewing needles, sewing machine, rope, 
  * Optics: various lenses
  * Other: various knives, sharpening stone, directional compass, drawing compass,
