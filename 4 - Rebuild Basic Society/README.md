# Core Functions of a Basic Society

## 1. Survival Essentials
* Water: filtration, cisterns, hydrology
* Sanitation: dry toilets, soap from fat/ash
* Food: irrigation, seed saving, animal husbandry
* Shelter: low-tech structures, insulation

## 2. Security & Defense
* Watch systems, patrols, fortifications
* Community justice: mediation, consensus, exile systems
* Conflict prevention & de-radicalization models

## 3. Health & Medicine
* Preventive: hygiene, vaccines, diet
* Clinical: field surgery, splinting, obstetrics
* Pharmacological: herbal and improvised medicines

## 4. Education & Knowledge Transfer
* Literacy, math, practical pedagogy
* Oral tradition, memory techniques
* Disaster-resistant recordkeeping (e.g. microfiche)

## 5. Engineering & Infrastructure
* Roads, bridges, tools, wind/solar
* Materials: blacksmithing, cob, adobe, wood

## 6. Governance & Organization
* Consensus councils, elders, time-limited leadership
* Fair resource allocation and civic duties
* Urban design and land-use zoning

## 7. Economy & Trade
* Barter systems, time banks, ration tokens
* Guild systems for crafts & repair
* Local logistics: carts, bikes, pack animals

## 8. Culture, Ritual, Morale
* Stories, theater, shared meals
* Taboos, sacred spaces, rites of passage
* Play and games as mental relief

## 9. Strategic / Long-Term Planning
* Archives, universal pictograms
* Ecological restoration & rewilding
* Diplomacy across communities
