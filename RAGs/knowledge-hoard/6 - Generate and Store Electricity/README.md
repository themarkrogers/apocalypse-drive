# 6. Gather and Store Electricity

This section focuses on low-tech, salvage-based, and DIY systems for capturing, storing, and distributing electrical power in off-grid or post-collapse conditions.

## Basic Concepts

Essential Knowledge:
* Volts, amps, watts, and watt-hours
* DC vs AC: use cases, safety, conversion
* Storage (batteries), generation (panels, dynamos), regulation (charge controllers, inverters)

Tools Required:
* Multimeter (voltage, current, resistance)
* Wire cutters/strippers, crimpers
* Fuses, terminal blocks, soldering tools

Documents to Archive:
* Basic Electricity (TM 5-684)
* Photovoltaic System Basics (NREL, OpenEI)
* Off-grid power charts and calculators

## Battery Storage Systems

Types of Batteries:
* Lead-acid (car, marine, AGM, gel)
* Lithium-ion (18650, pouch cells, power tool packs)
* Nickel-metal hydride (old rechargeables)

DIY Battery Banks:
* Salvaging and testing 18650 cells (laptop batteries)
* Series vs parallel wiring
* Battery Management Systems (BMS): balancing and overcharge protection
* Safety: short circuit prevention, enclosure design

Documentation:
* Battery voltage & chemistry charts
* Charging curves by type
* Cell salvage tutorials and BMS wiring diagrams

## Solar Energy

Basic Setup:
* Solar panel → charge controller → battery → inverter → load
* Ideal for 12V/24V DC systems (LEDs, radios, routers, USB chargers)

DIY Sources:
* Garden lights, broken panels (partial output still usable)
* Window/roof arrays from recycled cells
* Micro solar systems for lighting & phone charging

Reference Guides:
* "DIY Solar Power" (Matthew Scarpino)
* "Solar Power for Beginners" (Dan Martin)
* NREL Solar Basics PDFs ([nrel.gov](https://www.nrel.gov))

## Wind & Micro-Hydro

Wind:
* Turbines from car alternators or treadmill motors
* Vertical-axis vs horizontal-axis considerations
* Tower construction (tripods, salvaged scaffolding)

Water:
* Micro-hydro from natural streams (requires vertical drop)
* Pelton wheel or bicycle alternator designs
* Piping, flow regulation, electrical load management

Recommended Resources:
* Wind Power Workshop -- Hugh Piggott
* Practical Action micro-hydro guides

## Manual, Thermal, and Improvised Systems

Human-powered:
* Bicycle generators
* Hand-crank flashlights & radios
* Treadle or pedal-powered alternators

Thermal:
* Thermoelectric generators (Peltier elements)
* Alcohol-stove powered USB chargers (PowerPot-style)

Other Improvised:
* Salvaged UPS systems
* Car alternators powered by small engines

## Distribution & Safety

Wiring Principles:
* Color coding, polarity
* Fuse placement and circuit protection
* Wire gauge and voltage drop

Inverters & Converters:
* DC-DC converters (step-up/step-down)
* DC-AC inverters (true sine vs modified sine)

Grounding & Lightning Protection:
* Essential for larger outdoor systems
* Copper rods, earth grounding, surge protection

## Printable & Archivable Materials
Diagrams & Charts:

* Wiring schematics (solar, wind, battery banks)
* Charge controller & BMS wiring diagrams
* Battery salvage workflows (18650 testing)
