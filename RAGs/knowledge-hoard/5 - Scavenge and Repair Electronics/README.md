# 5. Scavenge and Repair Electronics

This section focuses on recovering, repurposing, and repairing electronics using salvage from post-industrial environments and minimal tools.

# Basic Electronic Theory & Tools

Foundational Knowledge:
* Ohm’s Law, voltage, current, resistance
* Series vs. parallel circuits
* How to use a multimeter, continuity tester, and logic probe

Recommended Texts:
* The Art of Electronics – Horowitz & Hill (seminal textbook)
* US Army TM 11-685 – Electrical Fundamentals – [archive.org]
* Getting Started in Electronics – Forrest M. Mims (highly visual, easy to scan)

Practical Tools:
* Multimeter (manual preferred)
* Soldering iron (butane or electric)
* Desoldering pump, flux, tweezers, breadboard
* Wire strippers, helping hands, loupe

# Scavenging from E-Waste

Sources of Components:

Microwave Ovens: Capacitors, transformers, fans
* Old PCs: Power supplies, fans, switches, connectors, ICs
* CRT Monitors: High-voltage transformers, glass, copper wire
* Printers/Scanners: Stepper motors, gears, sensors
* TVs/Radios: Speakers, coils, RF modules, resistors
* VCR/DVD Players: Belts, infrared sensors, motors

Safety Considerations:
* High-voltage capacitors (discharge first)
* CRT implosion risk
* Toxic components: lead, mercury, lithium, beryllium

# Power Supplies & Storage

Improvised Power Systems:
* Rewiring ATX power supplies for 5V/12V DC
* Building battery banks from laptop/cell phone cells (18650s)
* Solar panel scavenging (from garden lights, rooftops)
* Manual crank generators from old exercise equipment

Battery Salvage Guides:
* Testing & pairing 18650 cells
* Creating battery management systems (BMS)
* Using supercapacitors for short-term energy storage

# Repair Techniques

Common Fixes:
* Replacing bad capacitors (visual swelling)
* Jumpering damaged traces
* Cleaning corrosion with isopropyl + baking soda
* Swapping fuses, resistors, and diodes

Testing:
* Use continuity mode on multimeter
* DIY signal tracer (audio amp + probe)
* Build test rigs using salvaged LED indicators

# Repurposing Electronics

Projects:
* Turning an old laptop into an offline knowledge archive
* Repurposing routers for mesh networks
* Using Arduinos or ESP32s for automated systems
* Building radios and sensors from kits + scrap

Guides:
* Hackaday, Instructables, Adafruit Learning System
* "Junkyard Electronics" zines and DIY PDFs

# Documentation & Visual Aids

Diagrams to Archive:
* Breadboard layouts
* Schematic reading tutorials
* Pinouts for USB, HDMI, VGA, etc.
* Logic gate symbols and truth tables

File Types:
* SVG: wiring diagrams, component ID charts
* PDF: repair guides and datasheets
* Markdown/text: pinouts, repair logs, inventory checklists

Make docs:
* "Field Triage Flowchart"
* "Component ID Quick Reference"
