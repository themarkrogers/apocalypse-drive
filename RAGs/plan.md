# Apocalypse Drive Plan

Resources that would be good inputs for an LLM as RAGs to enable it to provide expert-level, useful
advice during and after emergencies, disasters, national catastrophes, and/or societal collapse.

Two collections of info:
* one for enabling LLMs to give advice on problems
* one for teaching specific skills (and maybe enabling LLMs to do so)

Use an LLM to augment the initial drafts to my lists:
* Ask an LLM: What *additional* information would be most useful in these scenarios
* Tag documents and topics using LLM-assisted metadata enrichment.

## File Formats & Presentation for RAG

* OCR'ed PDFs of text resources (high-quality, tables readable).
* HTML / Markdown versions for easier parsing and retrieval.
* Video & audio: resources → transcripts (YouTube, field recordings, podcasts).
* 3D models (`.stl`, `.obj`), technical diagrams, schematics, and blueprints (as reference assets, not LLM-interpretable in raw 3D format).
* Decision trees and scenario-based flowcharts for troubleshooting and triage.


## Finding & Indexing Documents

Lookup / Discovery
* Library classification systems
  * Dewey Decimal System (simple, fast adoption).
  * Library of Congress (more granular & precise).
* HTML index page for easy browsing (like a digital card catalog).

Search & Retrieval
* Topic-based search
  * Top-level categories: Survival, Medicine, Engineering, Law, etc.
  * Subcategories by skill / technology / scenario.
* Scenario-based search
  * Decision trees and troubleshooting flowcharts (e.g., "I’m cold, what should I do?").
* LLM-driven tagging
  * Use the LLM to suggest additional tags and refine them.

## Additional Content to Include
* Building electronics & networks (from scratch & from salvage).
* Tools to make tools: forges, lathes, drill presses, band saws, balances, right angles, flat surfaces, lab glass, optics.
* Psychological resilience: Crisis leadership, mental health support, mutual aid.
* Environmental & local resource use: edible plants, herbal medicine, water filtration.
* Legal frameworks in emergencies: martial law, emergency governance, rights of civilians.
* Cultural and historical lessons: case studies of collapse, indigenous knowledge.

---

## Next Steps / To-Do
* Create a starter spreadsheet (Title, Author/Source, Category, Priority, Skill Level, File Type, URL/location).
* Develop a file naming convention for clear retrieval and consistency.
* Determine preferred formats (PDF/A for archival, Markdown for easy updates).
* Build a test RAG environment with a few documents to test retrieval and response quality.
* If needed, structure a database (Postgres, SQLite, etc.) to house metadata and link to files.

## LLM Query: Additional Information?
Use the LLM to ask:
* What additional resources, data types, or scenario-specific knowledge would be most useful for an LLM to provide expert advice during/after disasters and societal collapse?

## Another Thought

Apocalypse drive. Maybe upload it on torrents after a good v1 is made. Basic education in a very broad array of topics. 
* Apocalypse go bag? Lens, microfiche, tools, seeds, survival supplies, scavenging tools & gear, electronics tools, e-reader, mp3 player headphones and speaker, notebook & pencils, maps, coordinates to caches, portable LLM?
* Caches built for different needs: survival, defense, intelligence, counterintel, civil war, nuclear winter, hacking, rebuilding, medicine, bigger tools: LLM, 3d-printer, etc
  * caches contain: books, tools, microfiche & lens, supplies, gear, money, and meds
