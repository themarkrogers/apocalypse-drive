# Apocalypse Drive

The goal of this project is to preserve knowledge in case of an apocalypse.

Specifically, the goals are to preserve the source code, schematics, manuals, guides, and hardware needed to do the following:
* Read a document from a flash drive and print it onto paper.
* Recreate a small "internet" (i.e. the linux kernel, a debian OS, a web server, a ubuntu OS, a client computer, a web browser, a router, a small network, and any requisite compilers or programs).
* Create a radio tower and communicate with it via a handheld radio.

Additionally, this repo outlines a general trove of knowledge that would be valuable in case of societal collapse.
